# pascalio

pascalio is a powerful and easy to use library for accessing input and output connectors of a microcontroller from within the programming language (object) [Pascal](http://freepascal.org).

## What is Where?
- The directory [src](src) contains the library itself
- Checkout [doc](doc) for documentation file. You may use the fpdoc tool for creating more readable output.
- The sample projects in directory [test](test) are used for testing the library. Caution: You may get an idea on how to use this library if you read them!

## How to start
It is the easiest way to compile your applications on the target device (e.g. Rasperry Pi) as you donnot need set up a complicated cross compiling infrastructure.

1. Clone this repository or [download a zip file](https://github.com/SAmeis/pascalio/archive/master.zip) of the whole repository
2. Open the pascalio.lpk file in [Lazaurs](http://lazarus.freepascal.org/) and click *compile*
3. Open an existing project from the [test](test) directory or create your own application
4. Build up your circuit
5. Check your circuit again
6. Complie
7. Start the program as root

## Help?!
If you need help check out the sample projects. You may ask in the [German Lazarus Forum](http://www.lazarusforum.de/) for help.

If you want to help, don't hesitate to create a patch, issue or pull request.

## ToDo

- Create more examples and test cases
- Draw each example in [Fritzig](http://fritzing.org/) and create circuit diagrams
- Complete the Documentation
- Spread the world
