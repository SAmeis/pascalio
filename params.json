{"name":"Pascalio","tagline":"Input/Output library for Raspberry Pi or any other Linux based microcontroller","body":"# pascalio\r\n\r\npascalio is a powerful and easy to use library for accessing input and output connectors of a microcontroller from within the programming language (object) [Pascal](http://freepascal.org).\r\n\r\n## What is Where?\r\n- The directory [src](src) contains the library itself\r\n- Checkout [doc](doc) for documentation file. You may use the fpdoc tool for creating more readable output.\r\n- The sample projects in directory [test](test) are used for testing the library. Caution: You may get an idea on how to use this library if you read them!\r\n\r\n## How to start\r\nIt is the easiest way to compile your applications on the target device (e.g. Rasperry Pi) as you donnot need set up a complicated cross compiling infrastructure.\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository or [download a zip file](https://github.com/SAmeis/pascalio/archive/master.zip) of the whole repository\r\n2. Open the pascalio.lpk file in [Lazaurs](http://lazarus.freepascal.org/) and click *compile*\r\n3. Open an existing project from the [test](test) directory or create your own application\r\n4. Build up your circuit\r\n5. Check your circuit again\r\n6. Complie\r\n7. Start the program as root\r\n\r\n## Help?!\r\nIf you need help check out the sample projects. You may ask in the [German Lazarus Forum](http://www.lazarusforum.de/) for help.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help, donnot hesitate to create a patch, issue or pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
